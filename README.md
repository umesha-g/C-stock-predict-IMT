### About The Project

stock offering is a way that a company can rise funds for the company. this can be done through a
stock market. any investor can buy stocks from stock offering company or sell their own stocks to
another buyer. but no-one can predict what will be the next stock price of a specific company. there is
a technical method that can predict stock price changes. this project was carried out to find solution for above problem using this method. this method uses Brownian motion theory of physics with the Monte Carlo theory of statistical mathematics.Brownian motion describes the drift part and Monte carlo theory describes the random part of the formula. stock price can be calculated by creating computer application using above 2 theories. proposed programming language for this project is C. it is the 4th most popular programming language in the world. it is very suitable for this kind of mathematical programmings.

### The Brownian motion
Brownian motion is the irregular and perpetual agitation of small particles suspended in a liquid or
gas. In 1828 the Scottish botanist Robert Brown (1773–1858)published the first extensive study
of the phenomenon. Brown showed notably that this motion equally affects organic and inorganic
particles. If we assumed data points on Stock Price graph as particles, this theory can be applied
to the data points on Stock price graph. and we can predict where the next data point will be.

### The Monte Carlo theory
The Monte Carlo theory is a numerical technique to model the probability of all possible outcomes
in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the interference of random variables. It is a
technique used to understand the impact of risk, uncertainty, and ambiguity in forecasting models.
This theory can use to simulate random change of stock price.

### Error Percentage

Program Works as it Programmed to be.
Error calculated using Above output
Real Stock value for predicted day was Rs. 1024.86 Program Predicted Rs. 925.71

Error = (1024.86 − 925.71) / 1024.86 x 100% = 9.6745%
